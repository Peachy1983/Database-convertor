I uses advanced clinical reasoning skills to assess my client's occupational identity and competence enabling me to identify occupational deprivation and develop holistic treatments to suit the needs of the individual. I made the leap into independent practice due to my desire, passion and drive to provide high quality, person centred therapy to my clients. I primarily work with paediatric client's developing their ability to engage in activities of daily living. I enjoy working to improve sensory and motor skill impairments.

"hannaheburt","Hannah Burt","College Station, Texas, United States","US","Master of Real Estate Graduate Student at Texas A&M University","As a recent Texas A&M University graduate (December 2024) with a Bachelor of Science in Agribusiness and a minor in Economics, I have specialized in financially based decision-making, economic analysis, and sustainable land use strategies. These skills, paired with my current pursuit of a Master of Real Estate (MRE) from Mays Business School at Texas A&M, position me to make a meaningful impact in the commercial real estate industry. My journey has been shaped by academic achievements, leadership roles, and hands-on experiences. Highlights include: • Active involvement in the MSC Abbott Family Leadership Conference and Texas A&M’s Student Government Association, where I developed strong leadership and collaborative skills. • Volunteering with Restoration Church Bryan and affiliated ministries, where I’ve cultivated high moral standards and a passion for helping others. • Gaining adaptability and critical thinking skills through work experiences that span office settings and outdoor environments. I love the outdoors, deepening my love for the land. From the mountains of Northern New Mexico to the woods and lakes of the Brazos valley, I have spent many hours casting lines and calling gamebirds. I am an avid hunter, fly fisherman, and outdoorsman. My ideal weekend would be spent sleeping beneath the stars and exploring God’s green earth. I’m eager to learn from industry professionals and to broaden my understanding of commercial real estate. If you are looking for a fresh perspective, undeterred by hard work and passionate about land, let’s connect!
