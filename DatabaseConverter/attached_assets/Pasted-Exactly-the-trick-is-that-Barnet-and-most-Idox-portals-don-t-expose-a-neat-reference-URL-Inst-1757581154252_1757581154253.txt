Exactly ‚Äî the trick is that Barnet (and most Idox portals) don‚Äôt expose a neat ?reference= URL. Instead, every case has an internal keyVal token that drives the working link.

For your example 22/1437/OUT, the working link is:

üëâ Application summary (Barnet PublicAccess)

That R8XIV5JIJYI00 bit is the keyVal.

How to get the link programmatically

Search endpoint
Go to the search page with the reference in the query string, e.g.:

https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/search.do?action=search&searchType=Application&reference=22/1437/OUT


That page shows results; each ‚ÄúView Details‚Äù link contains the correct keyVal.

Parse out the keyVal
The link looks like:

applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=R8XIV5JIJYI00


Once you capture the keyVal, you can construct any tab URL (summary, documents, contacts).

Automated option
That‚Äôs exactly what the resolver script I made does ‚Äî it searches by reference, grabs the first result‚Äôs details link, and writes back the resolved URL.

‚úÖ So yes, I do have the working link for 22/1437/OUT ‚Äî it‚Äôs the one above with keyVal=R8XIV5JIJYI00.

Do you want me to adapt the script so it always converts a reference ‚Üí full keyVal URL and skips the failing ?reference= approach?

I checked it live just now ‚Äî the case page does load and is active.

Summary: https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=summary&keyVal=R8XIV5JIJYI00
 
publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk

Documents: https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=documents&keyVal=R8XIV5JIJYI00
 
publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk

Contacts: https://publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk/online-applications/applicationDetails.do?activeTab=contacts&keyVal=R8XIV5JIJYI00
 (shows ‚ÄúThere are no contacts associated with this case.‚Äù) 
publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk

If it still won‚Äôt open on your side, quick fixes:

Make sure there‚Äôs no trailing punctuation in the URL.

Try an incognito/private window (Idox sometimes caches odd sessions).

Try a different network (some corporate networks block publicaccess.barnet.gov.uk).

If you want, I can fold the keyVal resolution directly into the scraper so you can go from a reference like 22/1437/OUT ‚Üí working URLs automatically in one pass.

Done. I‚Äôve merged the keyVal resolver and the contacts scraper into a single tool so you can go from a bare reference (e.g. 22/1437/OUT) ‚Üí working URL ‚Üí Applicant/Agent fields in one pass.

Download the combined script: barnet_resolve_and_scrape.py

Readme / how-to: README_barnet_resolve_and_scrape.txt

Dependencies (same as before): requirements.txt

Quick start
# optional: create venv & activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python barnet_resolve_and_scrape.py "Nimbus Maps - Planning Data (10) barnet.xlsx" --out-xlsx "barnet_enriched.xlsx"


What it does:

If your URL is missing or not an applicationDetails.do link, it searches Idox for the Reference, captures the keyVal, and builds a clean summary URL.

Then it attempts the contacts tabs and extracts Applicant/Agent fields.

Outputs one enriched Excel/CSV with:

Resolved URL

URL Resolve Status (e.g., search_get, search_post, etc.)

Scrape Status

applicant_* and agent_* columns when found.

If you later want it to also pull documents or decision notices, say the word and I‚Äôll extend it.
